## Warning! Since 2023-09-26 ships with ESP32-C3 with set efuses to a locked boot loader and encrypted flash. There is currently no way to break these without expensive glitching gear.

## Old hardware instructions

Serial flashed - doesn't run Tuya. (Do not connect to mains while flashing.) 

The plastic dome is glued but comes off easily. The LED board must be levered out, which is difficult - don't bother squeezing the bulb in a vice that doesn't help. In order to access tight space around the ESP-WROOM-02 two capacitors must be removed and resoldered after flashing.
